// Title of File: ekg_pyserial.ino
// Name of Editor: Ashwin Sundar
// Date of GitHub commit: April 7 2016
// What specific changes were made to this code, compared to the currently up-to-date code
// on GitHub?: We want to just look at the x, y, z data without all this tap detection bus-
// iness. I deleted any of the code that was processing the data. 
//// //// //// //// ////
// Best coding practices
// 1) When you create a new variable or function, make it obvious what the variable or
// function does. The name of the variable or function should reflect its purpose. 
// 2) Comment copiously. Created a new variable or function? Explain why. Explain what
// your functions do. Feel free to link to sites that you referenced for information. 
// 3) Please compile your code and make sure it is functional BEFORE committing changes to GitHub.

  // Output x,y,z values - Commented out
  Serial.print(x);
  Serial.print(y);
  Serial.println(z);
