// Title of File: ACTIVITY.ino
// Name of Editor: Ashwin Sundar
// Date of GitHub commit: March 14, 2016
// What specific changes were made to this code, compared to the currently up-to-date code
// on GitHub?: Cleaned up the code. Removed unneccessary variables. Rewrote any variables 
// that had unclear names
//// //// //// //// ////
// Best coding practices
// 1) When you create a new variable or function, make it obvious what the variable or
// function does. The name of the variable or function should reflect its purpose. 
// 2) Comment copiously. Created a new variable or function? Explain why. Explain what
// your functions do. Feel free to link to sites that you referenced for information. 
// 3) For this particular piece of code, since it is written for the LightBlue Bean, the code
// WILL NOT compile in the Arduino IDE. You'll get a bunch of error messages about a lot of 
// functions not being "declared in this scope". That's because those functions only exist in
// the world of LightBlue Bean. You need to compile this code in BeanLoader, make sure it runs
// over there, then copypasta it into here, hit Save, and commit the change in GitHub Desktop. 
// Don't forget to provide a detailed description when you commit a file.

// Steps are integer values. I initialize step count at 0 when the sketch loads
// for the first time. I currently do not have a way to save the step count in the

// to analyze the data using Professor Spano's EKG algorithm here. The EKG algorithm establishes
// a baseline and a threshold for any set of periodic data.

double stride = height*0.414*0.0254; // inches to meters conversion
double distance = (stride*stepCount)/(1609.34); // miles traveled
double calories = distance*(0.57*weight); // calories burnt BASED ON LIVESTRONG
double literature_cal = ((stride*stepCount)/1000)*(weight*0.45359237)*0.7788; //Calories burnt based on literature review

// Once again, a placeholder. Bluetooth communications protocols need to go here.
