// Title of File: ekg_pyserial.ino
// Name of Editor: Muawiya Al-Khalidi
// Date of GitHub commit: March 21, 2016
// What specific changes were made to this code, compared to the currently up-to-date code
// on GitHub?: Wrote RangeOfArrayElements. Calculates the range of the array.
// showing the difference between the maxium and minimum value in the array. 
//// //// //// //// ////
// Best coding practices
// 1) When you create a new variable or function, make it obvious what the variable or
// function does. The name of the variable or function should reflect its purpose. 
// 2) Comment copiously. Created a new variable or function? Explain why. Explain what
// your functions do. Feel free to link to sites that you referenced for information. 
// 3) Please compile your code and make sure it is functional BEFORE committing changes to GitHub.

// Numerical differentiation describes an algorithm that estimates the derivative of a 
// mathematical function using values of the function separated by h time. numericalDifferentiation
// accepts two floats - a starting point f(x1), a finish point f(x2) and a time distance to the finish 
// point f(x+h). f is not a mathematical function. Rather, it's just the incoming analog data. When 
// this function is called, the slope between x1 and x2 is calculated. For our purposes, this is the 
// instantaneous rate of change of our data, although mathematicians might get upset at my liberal use
// of the word "instantaneous". Function has not been validated yet.
