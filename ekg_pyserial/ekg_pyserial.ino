// Title of File: ekg_pyserial.ino
// Name of Editor: Muawiya Al-Khalidi
// Date of GitHub commit: April 4, 2016
// What specific changes were made to this code, compared to the currently up-to-date code
// on GitHub?: Three main things where done: Firstly sizeof(array) returns the amount of bytes in the array
// thus a defined a variable to return the amount of elements in the array which is needed
// to calculate the average, standard deviation, and range. Secondly I created a circular array
// based on an already predefined array size and as of now set the size to contain any amount we need.
// I set it arbiturarily to be 250 elements this can be changed
// Thirdly I created a calibration function to fill the predefined array so that we can have
// an initial average, standard deviation, and range to calculate the threshold.
// Forthly I removed the delay functions and replaced it with the timer function & set it
// to sample the EKG every 10ms (sampling rate 100Hz), I also used the modulus operator to do this
//// //// //// //// ////
// Best coding practices
// 1) When you create a new variable or function, make it obvious what the variable or
// function does. The name of the variable or function should reflect its purpose. 
// 2) Comment copiously. Created a new variable or function? Explain why. Explain what
// your functions do. Feel free to link to sites that you referenced for information. 
// 3) Please compile your code and make sure it is functional BEFORE committing changes to GitHub.

//sizeof(array) returns the amounts of bytes in the array. Dividing the total amount of bytes in the array
//by the byte size of a single element in the array gives the total amount of elements in the array.
//http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sizeof -> c++ reference for 

#define array_size(array) (sizeof((array))/sizeof((array[0])))

//defining the size of the array, this is arbitrary & can be changed.
//Weaknesses of predefined array:
//1.Limited storage of EKG due to size of the array -> User could still have more inputs
//2.Wasted memory if we do not use entire array -> User may use too few array elements and waste memory (RAM)
#define array_length 250

//Using the timer function instead of delay function to set sampling rate
//Arduino timer function returns an unsigned long variable
//Created time variable to store milliseconds from the millis function
